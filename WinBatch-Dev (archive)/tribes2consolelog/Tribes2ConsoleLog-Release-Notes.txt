Quick readme on this release of Tribes2ConsoleLog.EXE - The Tribes2 Utilities to Cycle the Console.Log file once a day at midnite.

-------------------
Installation
-------------------

Make a folder under C:\Program Files or the like and then double click tribes2consolelog.exe

You will be asked for your Tribes2 root folder.

Tribes2ConsoleLog then waits until 12:00a the next night and then cycles the existing console.log file to save the contents of the current console.log file and make a new one. Each saved console.log file is then date stamped for later reference.
