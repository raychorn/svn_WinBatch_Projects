Quick readme on this release of Tribes2Missions.EXE - The Tribes2 Utilities to Randomize the default Mission.

-------------------
Installation
-------------------

Make a folder under C:\Program Files or the like and then double click tribes2misions.exe

You will be asked for your Tribes2 root folder and then the root folder for the mod for which you want to use this util.

Tribes2Missions assumes the following is true :

* The mod is {USB}Mayhem Mod vers 1.65+23669 or later
* bwadmin 1.04 or later is being used
* The dedicated server is running

Tribes2Missions then waits 10 mins and modifies your prefs\serverPrefs.cs file with a randomly selected Mission 
to be used as the default Mission whenever the server resets. The mission list is taken from the scripts\bwadmin\bwadminMapRotation.cs
file - this assumes bwadmin 1.04 is being used.

Note : This Utility program works ONLY with the {USB}Mayhem Mod vers 1.65+23669 or later.

Tribes2Missions assumes your Tribes2 Server is currently running.
