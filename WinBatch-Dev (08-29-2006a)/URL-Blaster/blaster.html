  <p align="center"><big><big><strong><font face="Arial">Hosting</font></strong></big></big></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">In the last 18 Months we have tried many hosts, with 12 sites of
  various sorts you get a good sample of the services available:-</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">It is worth relaying some of our experiences for your benefit! These
  comments are based on our experiences and may not be representative of the general
  services offered.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><strong>RIP OFFS - Avoid or treat with EXTREME
  CAUTION!</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>PBTech</strong></font> -&nbsp; 3
  months up front + set up fees. The site took ages to set up and then was very SLOW!
  Complaints were answered slowly and then the site speeded up! Only problem was that then
  the Site refused to allow downloads of any files above 60Kb! Useless!<br>
  We were promised a refund of our US$370 but are still waiting! - Basically a <strong>RIP
  OFF!</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>WideXS </strong></font>- Almost
  identical to PBtech, also based in Holland, servers in US. OK at first but watch the
  performance drop off as the server OVERLOADS! It was taking 30secs to download a 10Kb file
  at 33.6 - again no refund!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000"><strong>EXPENSIVE - You may not realise</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Tri Star Web</strong></font>&nbsp; -
  Good servers and very Reliable - but watch their business practises. What you sign up for
  may not be what you get. We agreed in great detail 60Gb a month over three domains for
  US$175 per month. Paid by Credit Card. Very soon we found they changed the rules, the $175
  a month only covered 18Gb and then without permission they charged the balance for excess
  bandwidth to the Card! Total was over US$450 a month for 55Gb!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#FFFF80">Cybercash - Smalltalker</font></strong>
  - Looks like an incredible deal and the servers are FAST! Watch out though, the cheap
  webspace quickly gets filled with LOG FILES, the promised WEBTRENDS analysis software just
  isn't there and you get billed WEEKLY at $1 per Mb over the original space and $9 per Gb
  over the Bandwidth, all billed to your credit card, even if you tell them not to! To
  upgrade incurs a Setup charge of $50 min every time. We signed up on 22nd of Month and
  paid a FULL months hosting fees but where reinvoiced on 13th of next month for a full
  month, i.e. the initial full month was 22nd - end of month! Asking for the PROMISED REFUND
  has failed to yeild a result, all you get is smart answers! Total charged to the credit
  card over three weeks was - $480+ Bandwidth was almost certainly less than 60Gb! ( Based
  on Previous host stats at a higher hit rate! )&nbsp; You also get hit by massive amounts
  of email notices, over 100 including answers to support questions (10),&nbsp; in less than
  three weeks! </font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Arial" color="#FF0000">SLOW and UNRELIABLE</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>VIRTUALynx</strong></font> - In Canada
  - the service is good and the staff helpful, it isn't really them but the location of the
  server. Links to Canada are POOR leaving you with a server that appears Slow and
  Unreliable. See <a href="http://www.internettrafficreport.com">www.internettrafficreport.com</a>
  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00"><strong>BJSquared </strong></font><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">- service decayed rapidly as our site got going. We assumed the owners
  site always got preference, couldn't prove it but our site was down a lot at busy times
  whilst BJSquared stayed up! Too SMALL to be a real service!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Quantum Group</strong></font> - After
  a month of trying, with massive downtimes we gave up! No charge but the cost in lost
  traffic was incredible! Support was useless!</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">We repeat that these are purely observations based on our experience
  with the hosts in question, they may have improved their services or our experience may
  have been a one-off position. However we feel that it is worth publishing this data, if a
  host listed above feels the report is unfair or does not represent the position accurately
  or has improved dramatically please contact us and we will publish amendments accordingly!</font></p>
  <p><strong><big><font face="Arial">Where do we host our sites now?</font></big></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Arial">The best deal in our opinion <font color="#FFFFFF">is at</font><font color="#FFFF00"><strong> SERVINT</strong></font> - not cheap but 100% reliable and Very
  Very fast. US$295 a month for up to 3Gb a day!<br>
  If your sites earns the cash - this is the place to be! Our top six sites now live at
  Servint!</font></p>
