Old Password: 
New Password: HNv&xw8Nz


Note your new password is composed of letters, numbers and special characters. De sure to enter your new password exactly as it appears in this message.


You may need to wait until the next server reset or mission change whichever happens first BEFORE your new password will work however you may continue 
using your old password until it can no longer be used.


It is our policy to make passwords as difficult to guess or remember so we can keep your ability to enjoy our servers securely in your own hands while 
at the same time making it as difficult as possible for others to abuse your clan name.


DO NOT communicate your password to ANYONE whether they are a member of {USB} or not. In case your {USB} clan name is abused you may lose your ability 
to connect using your clan name as well as your ability to Admin our servers.


If you have a static IP address and DO NOT connect to the Internet using some kind of dial-up ISP we could use your Static IP Address in place of 
your password since NOBODY else can be using your static IP Address since it is assigned to YOUR Internet Connection Account.
