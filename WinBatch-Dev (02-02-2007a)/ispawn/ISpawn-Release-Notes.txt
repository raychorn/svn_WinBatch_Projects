Quick readme on this release of ISpawn.EXE - The Tribes2 Utility to replace the Dynamix ISpawn.exe .

-------------------
Installation
-------------------

Make a folder under C:\ISpawn or the like and then double click ISpawn.exe

You will be asked for some information the ISpawn utility requires and then you be on your way.

ISpawn assumes the following is true :

* Your Tribes2 Server is launched using a .BAT or .CMD file
* The .BAT or .CMD file contains the following or something similar :

del ..\console.log
cd ..\
Tribes2.exe -dedicated -mod your-mod-name-here

The Tribes2 Server Port is specified in the prefs/serverPrefs.cs file and it MUST be specified in the Server Address
you type into iSpawn using the same format iSpawn expects and prompts you for.

ISpawn then waits for the number of seconds you specified initially (say 90) and then it polls the Tribes2 Server to
determine if the server is online. If the Tribes2 Server is not online it performs a restart and tracks the stats.

Note : This Utility program works with almost any game server including Tribes2.

ISpawn assumes the following:

* The Tribes2 Server it is told to operate with is currently running.
* ISpawn cannot be installed into a folder that contains any chars other than a-z, A-Z, 0-9 cuz it will complain otherwise.

ISpawn has a command line interface and it assume the parameters are space delimited and follows the same order as
the questions ISpawn asks the user for when ISpawn is started up :

ISpawn.exe parm1 parm2 parm3 parm4 ... parmLast
