The purpose of this program is to provide the means for executing a Cold Fusion page from a DOS command line. This is useful when it
becomes necessary to Schedule a DOS command line based program from the Windows 2000 Scheduler rather than using the Cold Fusion
background scheduler which has been known to be a bit buggy.
