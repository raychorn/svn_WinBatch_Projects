<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2>Yeah, that's right until you have 
been Authenticated you can't talk to anyone which means NOBODY will see your 
password assuming you got the ! prefix wrong. DUH !</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2>We have had a problem with imposters 
somehow getting our passwords, not that using your e-mail address is all that 
unique a password to use, so now YOU can't talk to anyone until AFTER you enter 
your password correctly.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2>Be advised we will NOT give out 
passwords via e-mail such as you might request in this kind of an inquiry 
however your password will be changed automatically once each week and when that 
happens you will get an e-mail telling you what your old and new passwords are 
with additional instructions to help you along in your quest to connect to {USB} 
servers.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2>Also the ONLY time you will ever get 
any instructions from us concerning "how" to connect is when you originally gave 
us your clan name and we responded with those 3 NewsLetters. Any future changes 
to those NewsLetters will be sent via the Password Change Notification System as 
part of the e-mail you receive whenever your password changes. Do keep your 
current&nbsp;e-mail address updated with us however you must send your e-mail 
address change notice from your old e-mail address which must be verifiable. If 
we are unable to verify an e-mail address we may require you change your clan 
name to keep someone from being able to change your e-mail address without your 
knowledge. We will request an Acknowledgement whenever an e-mail address change 
is requested.&nbsp; If you lose your password you must wait until the next 
password change notice is sent out.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2>Hopefully all of this makes sense 
since we do want ONLY clan members connecting as clan members for obvious 
reasons.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial size=2>Enjoy !</FONT></DIV>
