Note your new password is composed of letters, numbers and special characters. Be sure to enter your new password exactly as it appears 
in this message.

You may need to wait until the next server reset or mission change whichever happens first BEFORE your new password will work however you may 
continue using your old password until it can no longer be used.

It is our policy to make passwords as difficult to guess or remember so we can keep your ability to enjoy our servers securely in your hands 
while at the same time making it as difficult as possible for others to abuse your clan name.

DO NOT communicate your password to ANYONE whether they are a member of {USB} or not. In case your {USB} clan name is abused you may lose your 
ability to connect using your clan name as well as your ability to Admin our servers.

If you have a static IP address and DO NOT connect to the Internet using some kind of dial-up ISP we could use your Static IP Address in place 
of your password since NOBODY else can be using your static IP Address since it is assigned to YOUR Internet Connection Account.

* DSL Installation Plans Move Forward Slowly

We now have a tentative outside installation date of 02-28-2000 which means the outside wiring should be done by that date however this
still leaves the inside wiring which is yet to be determined. To recap: this DSL is a 1.5 Mbps Symetrical DSL - this differs from most
other run-of-the-mill DSLs in that the bandwidth is Symetrical; most other DSLs provide asymetrical bandwidth which means there is an
imbalance in the amount of bandwidth available for uploads relative to downloads. Due to the nature of Tribes and how bandwidth is
utilized by the game and game players - Tribes requires Symetrical Bandwidth which means the number of players connected at any time 
is limited by the slowest speed at which an Internet Connection may transfer data. Cable Modem Technology is asymetrical which means 
even though a cable modem may download files at something like 750 Kbps (aka 75 KBps) that same cable modem may upload at 
only 160 Kbps (aka 16 KBps) however this means a Tribes server may allow only approx. 7 players at a time because each player will
require approx. 2 KBps per connection. Symetrical DSLs are more costly than the asymetrical variety however they are less costly than
a comparable T1 which runs at 1.5 Mbps (aka 150 KBps).

* New Tribes Server Waits in the Wings

We have a 500 Mhz Pentium III Server waiting in the wings for the new DSL to be installed. We plan on hosting 1 BIG Tribes 1 server
on this server allowing a minimum of 14 Players but we may play around with allowing many more to see how many more can be connected
in order to get a feel for how this new DSL will operate with Tribes servers.

* AOL 5.0 causes Problems on YOUR computer

AOL is being sued via a HUGE Class Action Lawsuit (see http://cnn.com search for keyword AOL) to the tune of $8 Billion (yes, that's
Billion) because AOL 5.0 seems to limit which ISPs may be used to access the Internet to ONLY AOL and it may cause YOUR computer to
lock-up, crash or possibly corrupt data.

* Com Hack Device

Hacks into the enemy Communications Team-Chat and displays those messages for all team members of those on the team which deployed 
the Com Hack Device. The enemy gets NO notice that messages are being intercepted, just like the real world. Com Hack Devices may be
disabled or destroyed but MUST be deployed outside on SimTerrain. The Com Hack Device is a Passive Device however it will appear to
be a Sensor Jammer on your Command Map displays.
