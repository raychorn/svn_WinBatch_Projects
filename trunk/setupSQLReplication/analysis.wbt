; This script creates a report on the windows visible at the time
; the report is run.  Run the script.  Choose a top-level
; window of interest, and it will show pertinent information
; that may be necessary to use the Control Manager extender.

; Note that Tabbed dialogs sometimes must be displayed before
; their controls are brought into existence.  So when using
; tabbed dialogs, tab to the correct dialog first.  The
; cWndInfo example shows how to move thru a tabbed dialog.
