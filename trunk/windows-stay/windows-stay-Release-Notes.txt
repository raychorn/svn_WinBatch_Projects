Quick readme on this release of windows-stay.EXE - The Windows Utility to make active windows stay put.

-------------------
Installation
-------------------

Make a folder under C:\Program Files or the like and then double click windows-stay.exe

You will be asked to verify the windows for which you want to snap-shot the positions.

This utility is good for making sure certain windows remain where YOU want them to be. Okay, so let's say you are running a 
Tribes2 dedicated server which means you've got ispawn.exe running as well as some other windows and then your Tribes2 server
resets itself and the console window has moved to a different place than it was. You could walk over and manually reposition the
console window or you could allow windows-stay to do this for you.  The same thing works for Total Control v1.5 which seems to want
to reposition its main window every time a server got reset and Total Control v1.5 has to perform a reconnect.

windows-stay then waits 10 mins and then it repositions the windows you previously identified as needing to stay-put.

Updated this handy util to work correctly with Total Control v1.5.

Note : This Utility program works with any version of Windows.
